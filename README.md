# Desert Agro-Sequestration with Salt Repository Storage
## A Gigaton-Scale Carbon Removal Pathway Using Thermophilic Biomass and Geologic Salt Containment
"Match the world's most heat-tolerant plant with geological formations proven to isolate hazardous materials for millennia. Operate in deserts where nothing else works. Use waste water nobody wants. Turn mining companies' void liabilities into climate assets. Create reversible strategic carbon reserves worth more than carbon credits alone. Scale to gigatons without competing with food or forests."
